/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for DreamVault.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict authorization model based on path-based ownership and relationship-based access control. It leverages Authentication Independence by ensuring that each document contains the necessary fields for authorization decisions, avoiding costly and complex `get()` operations. OAuth integration is supported through the `User` entity's `oauthProvider` and `oauthId` fields.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - Users are stored in `/users/{userId}`.
 * - Couples are stored in `/couples/{coupleId}`.
 * - Transactions, Categories, and GoalBuckets are stored under their respective couple documents: `/couples/{coupleId}/transactions/{transactionId}`, `/couples/{coupleId}/categories/{categoryId}`, and `/couples/{coupleId}/goalBuckets/{goalBucketId}`.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own user document.
 * - Couples have their own documents in `/couples/{coupleId}`.
 * - Transactions, Categories, and GoalBuckets are accessible only to members of the associated couple.
 * - Data types and non-authorization-critical schema elements are NOT validated during this prototyping phase.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `coupleId` is denormalized into the Transaction, Category, and GoalBucket documents to avoid needing to perform `get()` operations on the parent `/couples/{coupleId}` document for authorization.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Data is segregated into collections based on entity type (Users, Couples, Transactions, Categories, GoalBuckets) to allow for efficient and secure list operations.
